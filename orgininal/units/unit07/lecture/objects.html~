What Are Objects?
</p><p>
Objects are things we deal with every day. PHP deals with objects, as do most
modern programming languages. These languages are called object-oriented or "OO"
programming languages.
</p><p>
OO is a way of trying to solve a problem in terms of real-world objects. Some
people are apprehensive at the thought of tackling this kind of programming,
and are perfectly happy to stick with top-down, procedural programs.
</p><p>
Just as the everyday objects we use are not switchblades and hacksaws, neither
are programming objects. They are just a way of representing data.
</p><p>
As PHP has evolved from a tool for building simple home pages to a language for
serious Web development, so has its support for OO. Once programs start to get
larger and more complex, planning and design become more important.
</p><p>
Think of a simple home page put together with some family photos, links, and blogs.
Then think of a Web site like Amazon or eBay where there are thousands of forms,
links, and transactions taking place all the time, all over the world.
</p><p>
The thought of putting something like that together is staggering. OO is best
suited to manage the complexity of such large Web sites. Even if you do not
program using objects, if you are reading and using PHP programs written by other
programmers, you are bound to run into this style of programming.
</p><p>
This unit gently introduces you to PHP objects and some of the features that have
been added to the language in PHP 5.
</p><p>
When talking about PHP data types, we discussed two types: primitive types and
composite types.
</p><p>
Like arrays, objects are composite types. They provide a way to organize a
collection of data into a single unit. Object-oriented languages, such as C++
and Java, bundle up data into a variable and call it an object. So does PHP.
</p><p>
Each object-oriented language you encounter is based on the same principles,
but often the terminology is not exactly the same when describing the concepts.
You could say that PHP is like Java and C++, but has its own way of dealing with objects.
</p><p>
When you learn about objects, they are usually compared to real-world things,
like a black cat, a modern painting, or a green pillow. Using the English language
to describe an object, the object itself would be like a noun: a person, place, or thing.
</p><p>
Nouns are described with adjectives. For the cat it might be described as fat and
furry with green eyes, four legs, and a tail; the painting is a British frigate,
oil on canvas, and sells for $52,000; and the pillow is green silk, square,
with dimensions of 18" x 18".
</p><p>
The adjectives that collectively describe these objects are called the properties
(or attributes) of the object. The object is made up of a collection of these properties.
</p><p>
In English, verbs are used to describe what the object can do or what can be
done to it. The cat eats and sleeps, and its tail twitches; the painting can be
framed, sold, or purchased; the pillow's dimensions can be increased or decreased,
its fabric and color changed, and so on.
</p><P>
These verbs are functions called <b>methods</b> in object-oriented languages.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Objects and Classes
</p><p>
Objects are defined in a class. A class is a template or a blueprint that defines
what an object should look like and what it can do.
</p><p>
A class represents a group of similar objects, such as a class of employees,
a class of hotels, or a class of cars.
</p><p>
The object in a class is a concrete person, place, or thing. Like a cookie cutter,
a class gives an object its form, and as with a cookie cutter, you can build many
objects of the same class.
</p><p>
The employee object might be described as having a name, address, and phone number.
Although the object can later change its values, it still belongs to the same class.
</p><p>
You can change Bob's phone number, but he is still in the employee class. You can
change the color of the car, but it is still in the car class.
</p><p>
A class contains a collection of variables (properties) and functions (methods).
</p><p>
Like a blueprint, by itself the class does nothing. It defines an object and its
properties and methods. Properties describe the object. Methods are functions
that determine the behavior of the object; that is, what kind of actions can be
performed on or by the object.
</p><p>
As you can see below, a class is a unit consisting of a name for the class,
in this case House, the variables that describe the house, and the methods that
describe the behaviors of the object, or what it can do.
</p><p>
A class is an aggregate or composite data type. Like an array that contains a
collection of key�value pairs, the class represents a collection of properties
and methods.
</p><p>
Example: A House class
</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="2">
<caption><b>class</b> House</caption>
<tr>
<td><code>
<b>(variables/properties)</b><br><br>
var $owner;<br>
var $color;<br>
<br></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>
<b>(functions/methods)</b><br><br>
function showHouse() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;statements;<br>
}<br>
<br></code></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>
Working with Classes - Defining the Class
</p><p>
To create a class you use the <b>class</b> keyword followed by the name of the class.
</p><p>
The class definition, like a function definition, is enclosed in a set of curly braces.
The name of a class follows the same naming conventions as normal variables
(minus the dollar sign) and the class name, by convention, starts with a capital letter.
</p><p>
For example:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
&lt;?php<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;class House<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(definition goes here)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
?&gt;<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
The class <b>House</b> might have properties (variables) such as:
<b>$owner</b>, <b>$address</b>, <b>$color</b>, or <b>$number_of_rooms</b>,
as well as functions (also called methods), such as <b>showHouse()</b>,
<b>cleanHouse()</b>, or <b>paintHouse()</b>, for example.
</p><p>
Once the class is defined, it is used to create specific objects.
Just as when you design a blueprint for a house, the real house does not yet exist.
You must build it from the blueprint.
</p><p>
The class is analogous to the blueprint and the object to the actual house.
We could build many houses from the same blueprint and we can build many objects
from a class.
</p><p>
Just as a house is located at an address, each object has its own memory address.
PHP provides the address and cleans up the memory when the object is no longer needed,
when the program ends.
</p><p>
Once we have the basic stuff of which houses are made, we can extend the blueprint
to add new features to the house, such as a new family room or a fireplace.
</p><p>
Classes can also be extended to create more refined objects. Extending a class
is called <b>inheritance</b>.
</p><p>
Inheritance allows the programmer to create a new class without writing a brand
new one. He or she can reuse an existing class and add some new features and
functionality. Inheritance is one of the benefits of OO that we discuss later.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Instantiating the Class
</p><p>
Once the class is declared, the object needs to be created.
</p><p>
In the real world you would build a new house; in the object-oriented world,
you would instantiate a new House class or create a new instance of the House class.
</p><p>
To make a new object, we use the reserved keyword "new". To reference the object,
we use the special variable <b>$this</b> .
</p><p>
Each instance of a class has the same properties (variables), but different
copies of them, so the values can be different.
</p><p>
For example, if you have two house objects of the same class, and each house
object has a property called $owner, the values assigned to $owner can differ
from house object to house object, just like in the real world.
</p></li>
<li><p>
What is "new"?
</p><p>
The difference between an object and a class is that a class is conceptual and
an object is real. The object is the actual variable that you manipulate.
</p><p>
You can assign and retrieve its values, pass it to functions, delete it, copy it,
and so forth. It holds a specific set of data.
</p><p>
The "new" keyword is used to create a PHP object that is an "instance" of a class.
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
$myhouse = new House;<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
The "new" keyword causes PHP to look for a class named House, create a new copy,
and assign it to the variable <b>$myhouse</b> .
</p><p>
A new House object has been instantiated, which is like saying "We just built a
new house and called it $myhouse," and to make another object from the House
blueprint, you could say:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
$yourhouse = new House;<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
Now we have two instances of the House class, two house objects: <b>$myhouse</b>
and <b>$yourhouse</b>
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Properties and Methods
</p><p>
Properties (variables) and methods (functions) together are called class "members".
</p><p>
The properties of a class are defined as variables. Before PHP 5, the keyword "var"
was used to define a public property of the class; that is, a property variable
that is visible throughout the current PHP script.
</p><p>
The "var" keyword has been deprecated as of PHP 5; you now declare public
properties with the "public" keyword.
</p><p>
Methods (class functions) default to public so you do not need to specify them as public:
</p><p>
PHP 4 example:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
var $owner = "John Doe";<br>
var $address;<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
PHP 5 example:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
$owner = "John Doe";  // Default is public<br>
public $address;<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
New properties (variables) can be added at any time.
You can assign initial values to the variables, but they must be string or
numeric constants, not expressions such as: <b>5 * 6</b>
</p><p>
A method is a function defined within the class. It describes the behaviors of
the class. It looks like any other PHP function in structure:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
function showHouse() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(statements go here)<br>
}<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
The one major difference between methods and ordinary PHP functions is the
<b>$this</b> keyword used to reference the current object, and in the way the
methods are invoked.
</p></li>
<li><p>
What is <b>$this</b>?
</p><p>
When a class is defined, the object is created later, making it impossible for
the class writer to know what the user of the class will name his or her objects.
</p><p>
To reference an object, PHP provides a pseudo-variable, named <b>$this</b> ,
which references the current object.
</p><p>
If the class itself had built the two house objects shown in the last section,
then it would be able to keep track of which house was being used.
</p><p>
But, of course we build the class first and later build objects of that class, so
<b>$this</b> is used to reference the current object of that class. For example,
if <b>$myhouse</b> is the current object of class House, then all the properties
and methods of the class apply to <b>$myhouse</b> .
</p><p>
If the class has defined a <b>cleanHouse()</b> method for each house object,
<b>$this</b> references the house object currently being used and
<b>$this-&gt;cleanHouse()</b> applies to that object.
</p><p>
In real-world terms, when I am in my house, I am not going to be cleaning your
house. Notice that each property is preceded with the <b>$this</b> variable and
an arrow operator.
</p><p>
If you have many house objects, then <b>$this</b> will keep track of which house
you are currently using, both its properties and methods.
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
function cleanHouse() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;echo $this-&gt;owner;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;echo $this-&gt;address;<br>
}<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
As we go further on, you will see how useful the <b>$this</b> pseudo-variable is.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The "-&gt;" Operator
</p><p>
After a class has been defined, it can be instantiated; that is, we create objects
of that class.
</p><p>
To assign properties and call methods, an arrow operator is used to get or set
the value of the property. For example, if an object called $myhouse is created,
to assign a value for the <b>address</b> property, the statement might look like this:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
$myhouse-&gt;address = "14 Main St.";<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
To call the method <b>showHouse()</b> , it might look like this:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
$myhouse-&gt;showHouse();<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
The name of the object precedes the arrow and the property or method so that
PHP knows to which object the property and method apply.
</p><p>
Example of a House class and creating and modifying objects of class House.
</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="2">
<caption><b>class</b> House</caption>
<tr>
<td><code>
<b>(variables/properties)</b><br><br>
public $owner;<br>
public $color;<br>
<br></code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>
<b>(functions/methods)</b><br><br>
function showHouse() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;echo $this-&gt;owner;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;echo $this-&gt;color;<br>
}<br>
<br></code></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<table border="2">
<caption><b>user of the class</b></caption>
<tr>
<td><code>
<b>(creating an object)</b><br><br>
$myhouse = new House();<br>
$yourhouse = new House();<br><br>
$myhouse->owner = "Jack";<br>
$myhouse->color = "yellow";<br>
$myhouse->showHouse();<br><br>
$yourhouse->owner = "Dave";<br>
$yourhouse->color = "red";<br>
$yourhouse->showHouse();<br>
<br></code></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>
The gettype() and get_class() Functions
</p><p>
PHP provides a number of built-in functions that return information about
classes and objects. A table presented later in this unit gives you a complete list.
</p><p>
Two functions that will be helpful as you start learning about objects are the
<b>gettype()</b> and the <b>get_class()</b> functions.
</p><p>
As you might remember from when we discussed data types, the <b>gettype()</b> function
takes a variable as its argument and returns its data type, such as string,
boolean, array, and so on.
</p><p>
It will return "object" if the argument represents an object that was created
using the "new" keyword.
</p><p>
The <b>get_class()</b> function will tell you the name of the class from which
the object was created.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of usage of the <b>gettype()</b> and <b>get_class()</b>
functions with objects.

The properties or variables for the House class are $owner and $address.
Both properties have been assigned inital string values.
</p><p>
A method or function for the House class is also declared.
</p><p>
The <b>gettype()</b> built-in function returns the data type of $this.
Because $this represents the current object, the type returned is "object".
</p><p>
The <b>get_class()</b> function returns the name of the class to which the
object represented by $this belongs.

Creating a Complete Class
</p><p>
Now that we have defined some of the pieces involved in creating a class,
we will build one from scratch.
</p><p>
The following example defines an <b>Employee</b> class and then creates some
objects of that class. First, here is a diagram of the class.
</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="2">
<caption><b>class</b> Employee</caption>

<b>(variables/properties)</b><br><br>
public $name;<br>

<p>
A class named Employee is defined with properties that are declared public,
meaning they are visible throughout your script.
</p><p>
<b>printPersonInfo()</b> is a function or method, defined for the class.
</p><p>
Two objects of class Employee are created, and assigned to variables <b>$Heidi</b>
and <b>$Brad</b> .
</p><p>
We use the method printPersonInfo() to display the values of the properties of
each object of class Employee.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Displaying an Object
</p><p>
Previously, we used the PHP built-in function <b>print_r()</b> to view the
contents of an array. Now we use it to view the contents of an object.
</p><p>
In the previous example the output of print_r() would be:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
Employee Object<br>
(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[name] =&gt; Heidi Clum<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[address] =&gt; 1234 Somewhere Blvd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[phone] =&gt; 123-456-7890<br>
)<br>
Employee Object<br>
(<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[name] =&gt; Brad Bit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[address] =&gt; 4321 Sunset Blvd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;[phone] =&gt; 987-654-3210<br>

Functions for Getting Class Information
</p><p>
PHP provides a set of built-in functions that will return information about your
class and its objects. The table below provides a list of these functions.

Encapsulation and Information Hiding
</p><p>
Encapsulation and information hiding are closely related terms you will hear
often in the object-oriented world.
</p><p>
We use encapsulation when combining the properties and methods to make a class.
By encapsulating the data in the class, the details of the class can be hidden
from the user.
</p><p>
When we created ordinary functions, the instructions were encapsulated within
the function definition. When you call a function, you do not know all the
details of how it works, you just need to know how to call it, what arguments
to pass, and what it returns.
</p><p>
When you create an object, you must know how to use its methods to access it.
The details of the object are encapsulated within the class.
</p><p>
Information hiding is obscuring the details of the class from the user.
</p><p>
In the previous example, the Employee class gave Heidi her own name, phone,
and address. However, Heidi's information was "public" in scope. It could be
directly accessed from outside the class.
</p><p>
The user of the class could change Heidi's address and phone number. What if
you do not want anyone to change Heidi's address or phone number?
</p><p>
Often we have objects in which we do not want to allow direct access to the
object's variables. For example, a bank account object might have a variable
representing the account balance.
</p><p>
This data should not be available to anyone outside the class, and to access it,
the user should use methods provided specifically for that purpose. Methods such
as makeDeposit(), makeWithdrawal(), and getBalance() should be the only way to
manipulate the account balance, similar in the real world to using an ATM machine.
</p><p>
In the object-oriented world, you will often hear the phrase, "Access private
data with public functions".
</p><p>
Key principles of OO are encapsulation and information hiding; that is,
combining methods and properties into a class and keeping the class variables
hidden from direct access by the class user.
</p><p>
Data hiding helps to protect the object's data from being corrupted, and if the
class implementation is modified, this should not affect the way the class is used;
just as when you have the oil changed in your car, you do not change the way you
see the car or how you drive it.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Class Members and Scope
</p><p>
The term <b>members</b> refers to the properties and methods of a class,
and the term <b>scope</b> refers to where the members can be accessed within
the program.
</p><p>
Properties and methods are prefaced with a scope descriptor, such as <b>public</b>
, <b>private</b> , or <b>protected</b> .
</p><p>
If a member is not prefaced by a scope descriptor, it is considered to be public.
You should always specify a scope descriptor for properties.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Public Scope
</p><p>
Public scope is the default scope for all properties and methods of an object.
Public means that class members can be accessed from everywhere in the script
and are not restricted to the class.
</p><p>
In the previous example the name, address, and phone properties were public.
From anywhere within the script, the value of those properties could be changed.
</p><p>
Prior to PHP 5, the "public" scope descriptor was var; now you would use "public".
Methods themselves do not require a descriptor and are public by default.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Private Scope
</p><p>
Private members are visible or accessible only in the class that defines them.
They are not directly accessible outside the class or to subclasses.
</p><p>
If you create private variables, then public methods can be used to manipulate
the data. In the following example, the three variables of the Employee class
are declared private. It is not possible for some part of the program outside
the class to change or manipulate the values of these variables � a good thing.
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
class Employee {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;private $name;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;private $phone;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;private $address;<br>
}<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
</p><p>
The methods used to manipulate this data would be publicly available.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Protected Scope
</p><p>
If you create a new class from an existing class, the private members will not
be available to the new class.
</p><p>
Protected members are available to the class where they are created and to any
subclasses.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Example Using Private Scope
</p><p>
The following example includes a <b>BankAccount</b> class. The only property is
the balance that is marked private.
</p><p>
The only way this balance can be changed by a user from outside the class is
through its public methods. This example hides the balance from the user.
The properties and methods are encapsulated within the BankAccount class.

The class <b>BankAccount</b> is defined with only one variable $balance,
initially set to zero. The keyword private tells PHP that this variable can be
accessed only from within the class and not from outside.
</p><p>
The only way to alter the balance is through the class methods. Method
makeDeposit() will add the $amount to $this->balance.
</p><p>
Similarly, the function makeWithdrawal() will deduct $amount from $this-> balance.
</p><p>
The getBalance() method returns the value of the current balance. Although the

Magic Methods
</p><p>
PHP provides special methods that are invoked automatically based on what the
program is doing such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>creating an object,</li>
<li>setting a property value,</li>
<li>retrieving a value, or</li>
<li>destroying an object.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A <b>constructor</b> is a magic method that is invoked when you call "new" to
create a new object.
</p><p>
A <b>get</b> or <b>set</b> method is invoked when you access the object to
display it or modify its value.
</p><p>
A <b>destructor</b> method is invoked when your program ends and any existing
objects must be destroyed.
</p><p>
These special methods have names starting with two underscores: <b>__construct()</b>
, <b>__destruct()</b> , <b>__set()</b> , and <b>__get()</b> We discuss each of
the "magic" methods in the following sections.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Constructors
</p><p>
A constructor, as the term implies, is a builder or creator. When you assign
values to properties in a class, PHP will automatically build or construct a
new object when "new" is called by the user of the class.
</p><p>
When we created a new house, new employee, and new bank account, we did not
explicitly call a constructor. We let PHP create the object and assign the
properties to it.
</p><p>
If you want to customize the initialization of an object, PHP lets you define
a constructor method of your own.
</p><p>
Once the object has been created with new,
PHP will check to see if you have defined a constructor, and if so, it will
automatically be called.
</p><p>
This magic method is called right after new has created the object. For example,
to set the initial bank account balance to zero for a new bank account,
a constructor could be defined to perform this initial task.
</p><p>
Although functionally the same, PHP 4 and PHP 5 use a different syntax for
creating constructor methods.
</p><p>
PHP 4 constructor methods are named with the same name as the class. So, if you
have a class named MyClass, the constructor is a function named MyClass.
</p><p>
PHP 5 provides the constructor, a magic method called <b>__construct()</b> .
This method is not normally called directly by the user, but is automatically
invoked when the "new" keyword is used.
</p><p>
PHP 5 is backward compatible, so if a function named __construct() is missing
in the class declaration, the old-style constructor will be used if there is one;
if neither are declared, then PHP creates the object and assigns it values
provided in the class, just as demonstrated in all of the examples thus far.
</p><p>
PHP 4 Format:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
void class_name([mixed args[, ...])<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
function MyClass() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$this->balance = 0;<br>
}<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
</p><p>
PHP 5 Format:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
void __construct ( [mixed args [, ...]] )<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
function __construct() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$this->balance = 0;<br>
}<br>
</small></code></blockquote>

A House class is defined with a function that has the same name as the class.
It will be treated as a constructor and will be invoked when a new House object
is created. Prior to PHP 5, this was the only way to create a constructor method.

<p>
The House class is declared with the $owner property private and
the $address property public.
</<p>
The House class has a constructor. A class automatically calls this method for
each new object that is created. The constructor method accepts arguments of
varied types and number.
</p><p>
The class method <b>displayHouse()</b> is a getter method. It retrieves and
displays the properties for the object that called it.
</<p>
When the first new House object is created with "new", two arguments are passed to the
constructor of the class, the name "Joe", and the address "13 River Road".
</p><p>
The constructor is called automatically and will assign these values to the
object's properties. This instance is called $myHouse.
</p><p>
Then another House object is created. The constructor is automatically called
for this object and values are assigned to its properties.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Destructors
</p><p>
A destructor, as the name implies, is used to destroy an object.
</p><p>
A destructor method is called right before the object is released.
Releasing an object means that all references to the object have been unset or
the object has gone out of scope.
</p><p>
The destructor would be used to perform any final actions you want to perform
such as deleting old files, releasing resources, and so on.
</p><p>
Typically, PHP releases the objects at the end of each script.
</p><p>
Being able to use a destructor is a PHP 5 feature. PHP 4 does not have destructors
at all.
</p><p>
In PHP 4 you could create function (method) that simulated a destructor or you
could use the PHP <b>unset()</b> function to force the removal of an object.
</p><p>
But PHP 5 provides a specific destructor function named <b>__destruct()</b> .
This method takes no parameters, and it cannot be called directly.
It will be called implicitly when you release your object.
</p><p>
Format:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
void __destruct ( void )<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
function __destruct() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;print "Destroying object $this";<br>
}<br>
</small></code></blockquote>

<p>
This is the same House class defined in the previous example.
The magic <b>__destruct()</b> method will be invoked just before the object is
about to be destroyed; that is, if it is unset or the program is finished.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Accessor Methods - Setters and Getters
</p><p>
You do not have access to a real house or bank account until it has been created.
Likewise you cannot access an object until you have created it, and then you can
manipulate it, give it values, extract values, and so on.
</p><p>
Functions that give you access to an object are called <b>accessor</b> or
instance methods, often termed "setters" and "getters".
</p><p>
A <b>setter</b> is a method used to assign a value to a class variable,
and a <b>getter</b> is a method used to retrieve the value of a class variable.
Simply said, "Put something in, set it; take something out, get it."
</p></li>
<li><p>
User-Defined Setters and Getters
</p><p>
When you design a class, you do not have to make properties public, so any user can
set and get them directly. Instead, you can write your own customized getters and setters.
</p><p>
The properties can be declared as private and the only way they can be accessed
is through the public setter and getter methods provided by the class,
just another way to implement data hiding.
</p><p>
Individual setters and getters for each property are common in other object-oriented
languages such as Java. The disadvantage of having an individual setter and getter
for each property is that your program grows larger very quickly and thus more
unwieldy and harder to maintain.

<p>
The class properties for the Employee class are declared as private or protected.
</p><p>
A setter method specific to each property of the class is defined.
These methods are the only way the properties can be updated from outside the class.
In this implementation, the methods simply assign a new value to the class property.
</p><p>
A getter method for each property is also defined. It simply returns the current value
of the property.
</p><p>
The method getPersonInfo() displays all of the properties for the two objects.
Because the method is part of the class, it has access to the private and protected properties.
This method does not attempt to change the object's properties; it simply displays them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
PHP's Magic Setter and Getter Access Methods
</p><p>
PHP provides two magic methods, <b>__set</b> and <b>__get</b> , to allow the
programmer very flexible control over class properties.
</p><p>
To understand how they work and how powerful they are, let's first look at PHP's
default behavior when these magic methods are not declared.
</p><p>
If we create a totally empty class, we can dynamicly create public properties
for the class by simply setting them directly. PHP will simply create properties
as we set them, just as it does with regular variables.

<p>
Even though no properties were defined for the class Employee when it was created,
we are able to directly set and get any properties we wish to. PHP dynamically
creates properties "on the fly" as we give them values.
</p><p>
If we define the magic <b>__set()</b> and <b>__get()</b> methods for a class,
these special functions are called automatically whenever the user tries to
access an object's property either by assigning (setting) a value to it or by
retrieving (getting) a value.
</p><p>
The __set() method takes exactly two arguments, the object's property
variable and the value being assigned to it.
The __get() method takes one argument, the property of the object.
Each function can only be defined once within a class. 
</p><p>
You can define these magic methods as shown here to allow dynamic creation of
private properties with programmer control over the setting and getting of
properties.

<p>
The Employee class is defined with a single private property, the array <b>$attrib</b>.
</p><p>
The magic method <b>__set()</b> takes two parameters: one to represent the incoming
class property for the object, and the second to represent the value that will be
assigned to that property.
</p><p>
When the user of the class makes a statement such as:
<code>$Heidi-&gt;phone = "123-456-7890";</code>
, PHP automatically invokes this __set() method and assigns a key/value pair to
the array $attrib as follows: <code>$attrib['phone'] = '123-456-7890';</code>
</p><p>
The magic method <b>__get()</b> takes one parameter to represent the incoming
class property. Its purpose is to automatically retrieve the value of the object's
property when the user of the class makes a statement such as:
<code>echo $Heidi-&gt;phone;</code>
</p><p>
If the property does not exist (is not set) __get() returns an empty string.
</p><p>
You can write your own __set() and __get() methods to disallow dynamic creation
of properties, to validate that properties receive only allowed values, and so
forth.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Inheritance
</p><p>
The son inherited his father's title and estate. PHP classes can also inherit
from a parent class.
</p><p>
Inheritance is a mechanism of extending an existing class. By inheriting a class,
we create a new class with all the functionality of an existing class, plus we
can add new properties and methods to the new class.
</p><p>
In this way, the existing class can be extended without modifying its code.
</p><p>
When one class inherits from another, the inherited class is called a subclass
or a child. The class from which the subclass inherits is called the parent class,
the super class, or the base class.
</p><p>
A subclass is said to be derived from a parent class. In our examples we use the
terms <b>subclass</b> or <b>child</b> , and <b>parent class</b> .
</p><p>
Inheritance requires that at least one class already exists. This class will
be the parent class. A new subclass is declared by using the keyword "extends".
</p><p>
In the following example, the Person class contains properties for a generic
person: a name, an address, and a phone number.
</p><p>
Later we design a more specific type of person, a person who is employed.
However, because employed people are still "persons" we can create another class
called EmployedPerson that will inherit all the functionality of the Person
class and then extend that functionality by adding new members.
</p><p>
New members will be added, specific to employed persons. The body of the
printPersonInfo method must be changed because now there is more information
to display.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Constructors and Inheritance
</p><p>
When you create an inherited class, its constructor will be automatically
executed, but its parent's constructor does not get called.
</p><p>
To execute the parent constructor, you have to call it explicitly within a
subclass constructor with:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
parent::ClassName()<br>
</small></code></blockquote>
<p>
or:
</p>
<blockquote><code><small>
parent::__construct()<br>
</small></code></blockquote>

<p>
The Computer class is defined first. It will be the parent class for Laptop.
</p><p>
The $password property in the Computer class is marked private, so it will not
be available outside the class. A new computer object will have its own private password.
</p><p>
The $userId property is declared protected. It is visible and accessible within
this class and any subclasses of this class.
</p><p>
The public property $printer of class Computer is available anywhere within the script.
</p><p>
A constructor is defined for the Computer class in which the user ID and password
are initialized.
</p><p>
The new class Laptop is an extension of its parent, Computer. It adds more features
to the parent. For example, a laptop might be more concerned with weight and
portability issues, it is priced differently, it needs a carrying case, and so on.
</p><p>
The $password variable is created for class Laptop and marked private.
It is not the same $password as in the parent, but a separate and private property
of the Laptop class.
</p><p>
The Laptop class's constructor calls its parent's constructor. Otherwise, any
variables set in the parent's constructor will not be made part of this class.
</p><p>
An object $pc of the Computer class is created, then an object $portable of the
Laptop class (that inherits from the Computer class) is created.
</p><p>
The user does not have to know this. He or she creates the objects of the Laptop
class the same way he or she creates them from the Computer class.
</p><p>
A printer name (value) can be directly assigned to the $pc object's printer property,
because the property was declared public.
</p><p>
There are two lines commented out because they would produce fatal errors.
You cannot access private variables from outside either parent or child class.
</p><p>
Your instructor will demonstrate what happens when each of the lines is not
commented out.
</p><p>
The <b>get_object_vars()</b> function returns a list of public properties for
each class. The print_r function displays these properties.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Overriding Methods
</p><p>
Overriding is when you give the a member of a subclass the same name as its
corresponding property or method in the parent class.
</p><p>
If, for example, you have a value for a serial number property in the parent
class, in the subclass, you might want a different serial number for the new
product that was derived from its parent.
</p><p>
You might also want to create your own "display" method in the child rather
than use the one in the parent class providing a different functionality.
</p><p>
By using the same name for the members of the inherited class that you used in
the parent class, you are overriding the operations in the parent class.

<p>
First we declare the class <b>Person</b>. In this example, we extend the class.
By doing so, Person will become the parent or super class.
</p><p>
Class <b>EmployedPerson</b> will contain all the members of the class Person.
EmployedPerson is the child or subclass of the Person class.
The PHP keyword extends defines this relationship.
</p><p>
On lines 17-19 are the new variables specific to EmployedPerson. Note the name,
phone, and address properties are available to the class EmployedPerson.
They were inherited from the Person class.
</p><p>
The EmployedPerson class also inherits the function printPersonInfo() from the
Person class. However, we want to redefine the behavior of this child class to
include added functionality. This process is called overriding the method.
</p><p>
The child class's function <b>printPersonInfo()</b> calls the parent's function
printPersonInfo(). The keyword parent in PHP refers to the class that is the
parent to the current class, in this case Person.
</p><p>
In other words, we are overriding the original implementation of the parent's
method by first calling it and then adding some new statements.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Protected Access
</p><p>
When a class member is preceded with the private access modifier, it is visible
only within the class where it was created. If you try to access it directly
from outside the class, you will receive an error message such as:
</p>
<code><small>
Fatal error: Cannot access private property computer::$password in ...<br>
</small></code>
<p>
If you call a class method from a class with private data, its private data
will be visible, but if you call a method defined in a child class,
the private data of the parent class is not visible.
</p><p>
If a private property is declared in a child class with the same name as a
private property in its parent, it is unrelated to the parent's property.
It is a separate variable in its own right.
</p><p>
If a class member is protected, then it is visible within a subclass. It is
inherited by the subclass and treated in the subclass like a private member
but cannot be accessed outside the subclass.
</p><p>
It can be accessed in the child class through the public methods defined in
the parent and for methods defined within the child.
</p><p>
If the class member is public, it is visible throughout the entire script and
can be accessed directly from anywhere.
</p><p>
In the object-oriented world you normally access private and protected data
through public methods. It is, however, also possible to create private and
protected methods.
</p><p>
Note that when you try to get or set the value of the private property of a
parent class from within the subclass, instead of getting an error message,
you get nothing. You are simply ignored.

<p>
The class Computer is declared with a private $password property visible only within this class.
</p><p>
The protected access designator makes the $userId property available in this
class and any subclasses; that is, it is inherited.
</p><p>
Public scope makes the $printer property available anywhere in the script.
This is the default scope.
</p><p>
We define setter and getter functions to provide access to class members of the
Computer class.
</p><p>
The Laptop class is defined as a subclass of the Computer class.
</p><p>
The constructor method for the Laptop class calls the parent class's constructor.
The keyword parent is followed by the scope resolution operator "::" and the
method that will be called __construct().
</p><p>
The variable $userId was designated protected in the parent class. It is visible
within the child class. The password property was designated as private in the
parent class and is not visible in the child class.
You can only access this variable through public methods provided in the parent.
</p><p>
Public properties are directly accessible throughout the script.
</p><p>
The userId, a protected property, is visible in both the parent and the subclass.
</p><p>
The object $pc of the parent class Computer can get its private property as
long as it accesses it through its public method.
</p><p>
The object $portable of the child class Laptop cannot get the private property
of its parent even with the getter method.
